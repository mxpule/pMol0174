///This class is used exclusively by pMolSyntheticEngine. It conveniently links an array of codons to a raw sequence to allow rapid codon flipping and penalty score calculations. It has a mask to mark out residues which cannot be changed, and indices representing a frame which point to a part of the sequence currently being manipulated
